# Virtual Pets

We are to create a program in which the user interacts with virtual pets with different needs.

A virtual pet can have, for example, three properties such as (1) the amount of time before it needs to be fed again, (2) its anxiety level, and (3) the amount of time the pet can stand to be alone. Each of these properties change depending on which methods of the pet class are called.
