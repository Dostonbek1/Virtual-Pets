# Virtual Pets

We are to create a program in which the user interacts with virtual pets with different needs.

This is a simple game that runs on the console. In the game, you will your buy your favorite pet with different characteristics, such as color, age, etc. After you buy him/her, you will need to look after them and provide basic needs for them, such as feeding them, or taking them to a bathroom. 

# To play the game:
1. Clone this repo or download it as a `.zip` folder. 
2. Run `virtual_pets.py` file on your local machine (make sure you have **python** installed on your machine for the file to run).
3. Enjoy the game!

**P.S.** Please, feel free to provide your feedback on this game. Also, you are more than welcome if you would like to contribute or improve the game.
